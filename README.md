# Hi, I'm [Shayla (Yixuan)](www.linkedin.com/in/yixuanlu17) 👋 🤟
I believe that data tells us more than just numbers, it helps us understand our users and their desires. I want to pursue data science because I want the business to use data to maximize their value.

I am passionate about data! I pride myself on my strong analytical skills and my ability to resolve potentially difficult situations. With 2 years of work experience and strong academy background, I have a strong insight into data. I am skilled in Python/R, proficient at writing statements with SQL,  designing A/B test and visualizing data with Tableau, power BI.

<!--- Current Projects (WIP)

♫ [**_Spotify Music Recommender_**](https://bw-spotify.netlify.app/) - I'm working on re-designing and improving a music recommendation engine using Spotify tracks

_Tech Stack:_ React, Node JS, AWS Amplify, Python, SQLite3


🌱 [**_Digital Garden_**](https://www.kovacova.ca/) - I'm developing a React Web App & Blog in line with the Digital Gardening philosophy
